Hello World! My name is Erica Bertan and I'm 24 years old. I live in Manaus, located at
Amazonas, a state in Brazil.

In this blogpost, I want to show you my personal projects and contributions,
specially the period of my master's degree.

I've been working at MÃ©liuz for 2 years and a half with data-related products.

That's it! For more information, follow me on my social media.

Wubba lubba dub dub!
