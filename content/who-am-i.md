Hello World! My name is Erica Bertan and I'm 24 years old. I live in Manaus,
located at Amazonas, a state in Brazil.

I have mostly worked with some solutions for retails needs, focused on
data-related and recommendation systems problems. Furthermore, I developed
components to fetch data to enrich our models and analysis.
I have experience with gRPC Python services and tools like BigQuery,
Storage, Cloud Data Lab on Google Cloud Platform.

In this blogpost, I want to show you my personal projects and contributions,
specially in the period of my master's degree. I have started my research
in March 2019, and the theme is about Concept Drift. We're specifically
studing dynamic selection of classifiers to solve the problem of Concept Drift.

For a while, that's it. I hope you enjoy and let's have some fun here! Please,
make yourself confortable to contact me for inquires and suggestions.

Wubba lubba dub dub!
